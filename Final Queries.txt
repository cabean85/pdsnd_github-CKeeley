Question 1: Create a query that lists the film category it is classified in, the rating,  and the number of times it has been rented out

SELECT title, rating, name, COUNT(rental_id)
FROM film_category
JOIN film
ON film.film_id = film_category.film_id
JOIN inventory 
ON inventory.film_id = film.film_id
JOIN rental
ON rental.inventory_id = inventory.inventory_id
JOIN category
ON category.category_id = film_category.category_id
GROUP BY title, rating, name
ORDER BY name, rating, title

Question 2: Determine the Total and Average Spent on Rentals a Month

SELECT rental.rental_id, payment.payment_id, payment.amount, date_trunc('month', payment.payment_date), AVG(payment.amount) OVER(partition by date_trunc('month', payment_date) order by payment.payment_date) as avg_month_payment
FROM rental
JOIN payment 
ON rental.rental_id = payment.rental_id
ORDER BY payment.payment_date asc


Question 3: Determine the Movie Category that was Rented Out the Most 

SELECT CONCAT(customer.first_name, ' ', customer.last_name) as cust_name, category.name, 
COUNT(category.name) as number_rentals from category
INNER JOIN film_category on category.category_id = film_category.category_id
INNER JOIN film on film_category.film_id = film.film_id
INNER JOIN inventory on film.film_id = inventory.film_id
INNER JOIN rental on inventory.inventory_id = rental.inventory_id
INNER JOIN customer on rental.customer_id = customer.customer_id
WHERE category.name = (
	SELECT cat.name from category as cat
	INNER JOIN film_category as fc on cat.category_id = fc.category_id
	INNER JOIN film as f on fc.film_id = f.film_id
	INNER JOIN inventory as inv on f.film_id = inv.film_id
	INNER JOIN rental as rent on inv.inventory_id = rent.inventory_id
	GROUP BY cat.name
	ORDER BY count(cat.name) desc limit 1)
GROUP BY cust_name, category.name
ORDER BY cust_name

Question 4: Compare the rental numbers for 2 stores for the year 2005-2006

SELECT DATE_PART('YEAR', rental_date) YEARs, store.store_id, DATE_PART('MONTH', rental_date) Months, COUNT(*)
FROM rental
INNER JOIN payment ON payment.rental_id = rental.rental_id
INNER JOIN staff on staff.staff_id = payment.staff_id
INNER JOIN store on store.store_id = staff.store_id
Group BY store.store_id, rental_date
ORDER by count desc
